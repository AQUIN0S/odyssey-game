## Fight plan

### Phase 1 - A minute at most

- Polyphemus is strong but slow.
- Low attack range, moderate attack damage.
- Character has to collect the wine amphoras around the cavern while the men are fighting.
- When Polyphemus takes enough damage, he sits for a breath with his mouth open and eye closed.
- Pouring the wine into his mouth increases his drunkenness.

### Phase 2 - 4 minutes on average

- Polyphemus gains a club.
- Attack range increased to be able to reach the soldiers surrounding him.
- Attacks will start damaging the soldiers heavily.
- Aim is to weaken him enough that he succumbs to the sleep draught.

### Phase 3 - 3 minutes on average

- Polyphemus is blind but sent into a mad rage.
- Gains a charge attack that is not aimed, but is deadly.
- Aim to get the sheep out of the cave.
